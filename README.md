## What is it?
Hearo is a web-app designed to help mute, deaf and blind students excel in an educational environment. It was developed for an Amazon-hosted Hackathon in the American University of Cairo, sponsored by the Computer Science and Engineering Association of AUC.

The app allows mute students to ask questions using text-to-speech, blind students to read the board using text recognition and text-to-speech, and deaf students to listen to professors using speech-to-text.

## FAQs
### Why are you releasing it open-source?
Despite our hard work, we don't think this will make it as a proper app due to the pricing and limitations of AWS. But we're still proud of the idea, and the UI, and some of the implementation. We're hoping for others to take over the project and help the disabled community.
### Did you consult deaf/blind/mute students?
Unfortunately, we did not have time to do more research into whether the concepts and design were appropriate, but we did our best to be respectful to them.
### What's "Kool Koalas" and why are they referenced in the code?
That's our codename. Whenever you see this in the code, replace it with your own repository.
### What is the License?
This product is completely open source, use it however you'd like. We'd like it if you'd attribute the five of us though!
